            I started this project around the beginning of May 2025.
            It was for a dear friend who cheered me during difficult times.<br>
            Perhaps my motivation is as inconsistent as the musical aspect of this project had already been done two months prior.
            Only then did I start making the video concept.

            These are the original sketches for the video.
            It was based off of a TV show about dreams (at least that's what I think it was about).
            A lot of unused objects are displayed here.<br>
            Such as the magic wand, the striped little white tiger cub, the sockpuppets, and carousel-like building from the TV show.

        <p class="Pcenter">
            Then, I sketched the character design and recreated it in Blender.
            After that, I chose the colors for her.

        </div>

        <p class="Pcenter">
            While I was recreating her outlines in with Grease Pencil in Blender, I also made the boat model.
            I used reference from the opening scene of the TV show.
