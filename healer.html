            Personal Project

        <p class="Pcenter">
            I started this project around the beginning of May 2025.
            It was for a dear friend who cheered me during difficult times.<br>
            Perhaps my motivation is as inconsistent as the musical aspect of this project had already been done two months prior.
            Only then did I start making the video concept.
        </p>

            These are the original sketches for the video.
            It was based off of a TV show about dreams (at least that's what I think it was about).
            A lot of unused objects are displayed here.<br>
            Such as the magic wand, the striped little white tiger cub, the sockpuppets, and carousel-like building from the TV show.

        </div>

        <p class="Pcenter">
            Then, I sketched the character design and recreated it in Blender.
            After that, I chose the colors for her.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p class="Pcenter">
            While I was recreating her outlines in with Grease Pencil in Blender, I also made the boat model.
            I used reference from the opening scene of the TV show.
        </p>

        <div class="gallery">

        </div>

        <p class="Pcenter">
            I settled on an image for the stary sky background, and created the environment.
            Then I finalised the character's form.<br>
            I've also added a lamp to the boat and a geometry behind her to create a shadow.<br>
            Finally, it was time to make the constellations.
        </p>

        <div class="gallery">
            <img src="healer/paper_sketch_constellations.jpeg" style="height: auto; max-height: 10cm;">
            <img src="healer/paintdotnet_constellations.png" style="height: auto; max-height: 10cm;">
        </div>

        <p class="Pcenter">
            I had already sketched the constellations on paper,
            so what I had to do was to arrange them in the sky.<br>
            I did this in Paint.NET, using reference images of the subjects.
            It was quite fun adapting them into constellation forms.<br>
            Some were tricky to convert because I wanted to keep the details so that the subjects would be recognizable,<br>
            but I also needed them to be simple in order to look like constellations.<br>
            <br>
            When all the art were ready to go, I rendered them all out into a sequence of images and edited them with the music.<br>
            And out came the final piece you see below:

        <p class="Pcenter">
            This was the fastest I've ever completed a project (and I barely have any complete projects).<br>
            Except for the music, the entire work took under a week to finish.<br>
            I couldn't be more proud of the end result, and I'm happy that I've made something worthwhile.<br>
            <br>
            Thank you for viewing my project.
