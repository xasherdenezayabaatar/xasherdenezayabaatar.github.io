## ⚙️ Bonus (Optional)
If you added any bonus features, describe them here:

**Feature:** Responsive Design, such as the buttons altering their styles when hovered.
**Effect:** It makes the user feel recognised, their act of simply hovering over some elements caused them to act in a subtle way.
**Implementation:** I used CSS's transition-duration property to get smooth transitions.
