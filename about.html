                Hi! My name is Khash, and I'm from Mongolia.<br>
                I'm someone who admires stuff people put their heart and effort into.<br>
                <br>
                Such as these open-source projects:<br>
            </p>

            <div class="gallery">
                <img style="height: 2cm;" class="img-light" src="https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blender_logo_no_socket_white-1280x391.png">

            </div>

            <p class="Pcenter">
                Krita,
                Godot,
                etc),
                indie games (Undertale, Deltarune, Omori, etc),
                and indie films (The Amazing Digital Circus, Murder Drones, Knights of Guinevere).
                As someone who is inspired of such dedicated projects, I try to create my own stuff too.
                I like to draw on my sketchbooks and on Krita,
                make music on FL Studio, and edit videos on Blender.
                I'm also learning to make games on Godot.
                Growing up, I've had few friends who enjoyed the same things as me.
                I am very fortunate to have learned English because I'm able to understand what creators have made.
                Most people in my country, however, aren't fluent in English,
                so they miss out on a lot of great content.
                This is because Mongolian translators aren't the best at translating these things.
