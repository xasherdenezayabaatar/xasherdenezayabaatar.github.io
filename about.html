                Hi! My name is Khash, and I'm from Mongolia.
                I love to make original creative works.<br>
                <br>
                These are the main programs I use to make things (most of them are free and open-source):<br>

                    <!-- yes i know it's a paid program, but if you search for the preserved older versions on their forum website (u gotta login, dw it's free) there's version 20.9, what u can do is download that and use a hex code editor to hack your project file open - in the hex code, look for 1C (should be within the first 3 lines) and change the 00 beside it to 01. boom, now u can open it. but u cant use any TRIAL VERSION plugins, thats one limitation, but hey u can still use third-party plugins :D -->

                I'm someone who admires stuff people put their heart and effort into.
                indie games
                (<img style="height: 0.5cm;" class="img-light" src="https://www.pngplay.com/wp-content/uploads/11/Undertale-Logo-Download-Free-PNG.png">,

                Omori,
                etc),
                and indie films (The Amazing Digital Circus, Murder Drones, Knights of Guinevere).
                As someone who is inspired of such dedicated projects, I try to create my own stuff too.
                I like to draw on my sketchbooks and on Krita,
                make music on FL Studio, and edit videos on Blender.
                I'm also learning to make games on Godot.
                Growing up, I've had few friends who enjoyed the same things as me.
                I am very fortunate to have learned English because I'm able to understand what creators have made.
                Most people in my country, however, aren't fluent in English,
                so they miss out on a lot of great content.
                This is because Mongolian translators aren't the best at translating these things.
