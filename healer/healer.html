            I started this project around the beginning of May 2025.<br>
            It was for a dear friend who cheered me during difficult times.<br>
            Perhaps my motivation is inconsistent as the musical aspect of this project had already been done two months prior.<br>
            <br>
            Only then did I start making the video concept.

            These are the original sketches for the video.
            It was based off of a TV show about dreams (at least that's what I think it was about).
